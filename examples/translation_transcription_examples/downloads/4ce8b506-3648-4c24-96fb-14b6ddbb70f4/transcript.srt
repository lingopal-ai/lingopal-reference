1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]
Things were just starting to look up for Jorge when the thing with the TV happened.

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:08,249
[SPEAKER_02]
He just moved to a new town, started his life over, found some work, got a place.

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,662
[SPEAKER_02]
Yours is searching around in vagueness, were endless.

4
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:15,437
[SPEAKER_03]
It's going well. Like the way that I'm procrastinating now is by like doing work, you know?

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,880
[SPEAKER_03]
you know, I'm coming into my own. Like I feel good. I'm paying

6
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:20,702
[SPEAKER_03]
Bill's relatively on time.

7
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:29,410
[SPEAKER_02]
I moved to New York City, which was scary, and lucked into an apartment that real New Yorkers told him was a find, a little studio in the East Village, one room, good location, cheap.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,578
[SPEAKER_02]
And then one night he's sitting at his table, watching the bachelorette on TV.

9
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:38,320
[SPEAKER_02]
And it's the episode where the bachelorette has whittled it down to four guys that she's going to pick one from eventually.

10
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,935
[SPEAKER_02]
and she's in New York City visiting one of the potentials.

11
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:51,111
[SPEAKER_03]
And, you know, so he goes out to dinner with his with his family and they're, you know, they eat and, you know, they've got the shifty-eyed sister and, you know, like everybody's family acts the exact same way, you know?

12
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,942
[SPEAKER_03]
and then and then they get in the limousine and

13
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,709
[SPEAKER_03]
They they decide to go back to his apartment.

14
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,346
[SPEAKER_03]
Now like, now I'm

15
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,181
[SPEAKER_03]
Now I'm on the I'm on the edge of my seat.

16
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:07,379
[SPEAKER_03]
you know, I just moved I moved to New York, like it's an enormous city and

17
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:13,892
[SPEAKER_03]
I would be so excited if I could recognize us through it. I would be so excited. It would just make me so happy.

18
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,812
[SPEAKER_03]
And so I'm totally I'm totally sad.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:17,858
[SPEAKER_00]
Error: Invalid operation: The `response.text` quick accessor requires the response to contain a valid `Part`, but none were returned. The candidate's [finish_reason](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#finishreason) is 1.

20
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:24,119
[SPEAKER_03]
So they they get out of the limo and and he hugs her in the street.

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,452
[SPEAKER_03]
And they painted.

22
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:27,544
[SPEAKER_03]
and they show a building, they show an army.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,261
[SPEAKER_03]
And it's my honor.

24
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:35,054
[SPEAKER_03]
It's your building. It's my building. It's the awning to my building.

25
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:41,820
[SPEAKER_03]
It says the address, it says the street, it's, you know, it's possibly the only place in New York I actually know.

26
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:57,852
[SPEAKER_03]
And then they and then he opens the door and she comes in and it's my lobby, you know? There's my lobby. There's the row of mailboxes, you know? And I'm I'm just like, I'm I'm out of my chair and I'm can't talk. I'm like,

27
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]
you know, like pointing at the TV.

28
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:04,804
[SPEAKER_02]
If it were me, I would think like, are they here right now? Like in the building?

29
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,542
[SPEAKER_03]
you

30
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:11,841
[SPEAKER_03]
You're too smart. I mean, I was, you know, I was, I couldn't think. I was just like

31
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:21,814
[SPEAKER_03]
you know. It was, you know what I mean? I was just like, it was, you know, I was just flabbergast. It just couldn't be happening, you know?

32
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]
Why doesn't take the elevator up to the fourth floor? Jorge lives on the fifth.

33
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]
They walked down the hallway to the

34
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,319
[SPEAKER_02]
And then Jorge realizes something else.

35
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:36,462
[SPEAKER_03]
You know, he doesn't just live in the city as me. He doesn't live on the same street as me. He doesn't just live in the same building as me. He basically lives in my apartment.

36
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:40,073
[SPEAKER_03]
He lives in the exact same apartment. It's the exact same layout.

37
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]
So wait, so like, so the camera goes inside this apartment and you see

38
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,895
[SPEAKER_02]
your apartment basically.

39
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,814
[SPEAKER_03]
a much better version of my apartment.

40
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:50,603
[SPEAKER_03]
his is much better.

41
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,560
[SPEAKER_03]
the walls are lighter

42
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,404
[SPEAKER_03]
The place is cleaner, the furniture is nicer. He has a half wall.

43
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:01,842
[SPEAKER_03]
He's got a half wall. A half wall with a brick

44
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:02,787
[SPEAKER_02]
This is a test broadcast.

45
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,474
[SPEAKER_03]
It's like, it's like, it's like drywall, you know?

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]
But it but it seems like it has like some sort of like counter top kind of thing on it.

47
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:11,798
[SPEAKER_02]
And at that moment, Jorge gets this flash.

48
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:14,194
[SPEAKER_02]
He is not really doing all that well.

49
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,468
[SPEAKER_02]
This apartment is a kind of dump compared to this guy who's on TV.

50
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:22,615
[SPEAKER_02]
Plus, he's watching Trista Ren, the Bachelorette on TV, looking uncomfortable.

51
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,365
[SPEAKER_02]
in his apartment on National TV.

52
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,255
[SPEAKER_02]
In fact, she bails on the guy.

53
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:35,845
[SPEAKER_03]
she leaves the apartment and they cut to like that that that that head-on interview, you know, and she's just looking into the camera and she says,

54
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,401
[SPEAKER_03]
I've I've dated guys with with really bad apartments before.

55
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:42,595
[SPEAKER_03]
I I can't judge him on that. I have to

56
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:46,442
[SPEAKER_03]
I have to find out why why he feels like he can live in an apartment like this.

57
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:47,978
[SPEAKER_03]
student

58
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,923
[SPEAKER_02]
because of the apartment

59
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:55,605
[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah. Wait, he lost out on the Bachelorette because of the apartment? Oh, yeah. And it was your apartment?

60
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:56,635
[SPEAKER_02]
but better.

61
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:08,262
[SPEAKER_02]
Over the next few days, it all sort of goes to hell for Jorge. He's depressed, his new life does not seem so shiny.

62
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:17,256
[SPEAKER_02]
His New York friends console him. Look, they say, the bachelorette had never seen a New York apartment before. She does not know how people here live. This means nothing.

63
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,091
[SPEAKER_02]
which helps them for a while until one day.

64
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,538
[SPEAKER_02]
Jorge picks up the New York Post and reads.

65
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,997
[SPEAKER_02]
is an article about his neighbor Todd, the guy from the Bachelorette.

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]
Getting busted with cocaine.

67
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:29,609
[SPEAKER_03]
third paragraph.

68
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]
Toddman's fate on the Bachelorette was sealed the moment Ren set foot in this in his squalid Avenue A studio apartment.

69
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:43,362
[SPEAKER_03]
Do you understand the weight of that? Squalid.

70
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,298
[SPEAKER_03]
squalid avenue A studio apartment

71
00:04:47,057 --> 00:05:03,679
[SPEAKER_03]
So this isn't just like people from outside New York. This is the New York Post. Nobody knows New York apartments like the New York Post. These guys have been in the most squalid New York City apartments. It's squalid, you know. It's squalid, squalid, squalid.

72
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,442
[SPEAKER_03]
you know, there's not there's not that many definitions for squalor.

73
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,665
[SPEAKER_03]
There's not many ways to look at the word squalid.

74
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:11,661
[SPEAKER_03]
um

75
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:14,159
[SPEAKER_03]
Maybe they mean kind of hip, you know?

76
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]
Hahahaha.

77
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]
somehow, without ever meaning to.

78
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]
Jorge had the experience that a person

79
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:30,578
[SPEAKER_02]
if he actually went on to one of the reality shows and then got booted off the show.

80
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,345
[SPEAKER_02]
National television came into his apartment.

81
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,050
[SPEAKER_02]
and then kicked them off the island.

82
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,045
[SPEAKER_02]
by proxy

83
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,796
[SPEAKER_02]
He was like collateral damage to a reality show.

84
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:43,960
[SPEAKER_03]
you know, I I never I didn't want to be I didn't want America to judge judge me and

85
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,968
[SPEAKER_03]
Tell me my apartment sucks.

86
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:47,757
[SPEAKER_03]
I didn't want I didn't want that, but

87
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,604
[SPEAKER_03]
that moment when I was, you know, when when they came into my building.

88
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,304
[SPEAKER_03]
Nick, they opened that door and it was my apartment.

89
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:58,557
[SPEAKER_03]
I thought I was, you know, I thought that I was hot. I thought that it was, you know,

90
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]
I that's, you know, and then all of a sudden

91
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,729
[SPEAKER_03]
Biew biew biew.

92
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,264
[SPEAKER_03]
you know

93
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,145
[SPEAKER_03]
What was it?

94
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,090
[SPEAKER_03]
<no text>

95
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:18,975
[SPEAKER_03]
You lose. You lose. You lose.

96
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,005
[SPEAKER_02]
deux

97
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:28,510
[SPEAKER_02]
He says that if he hadn't just moved to New York City, if he hadn't just started this whole life, it would not have been the kick in the stomach that it was.

98
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,041
[SPEAKER_02]
Which brings us to today's radio program.

99
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:34,484
[SPEAKER_02]
From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass.

100
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,479
[SPEAKER_02]
Today on our show

101
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]
Starting from scratch.

102
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]
stories of people in that period of their lives when everything is up for grabs, they're starting over, everything is tenuous.

103
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:44,558
[SPEAKER_02]
Act one.

104
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,229
[SPEAKER_02]
Puppy love

105
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:47,292
[SPEAKER_02]
the business model

106
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,148
[SPEAKER_02]
Act two.

107
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,139
[SPEAKER_02]
Making money the old fashioned way.

108
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]
in that ad

109
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,835
[SPEAKER_02]
The story of a man, a limo driver to be exact.

110
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:57,501
[SPEAKER_02]
It begins each day from scratch with just a few bucks.

111
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,087
[SPEAKER_02]
It builds into

112
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,686
[SPEAKER_02]
thousands or tens of thousands by the end of the day.

113
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:03,205
[SPEAKER_02]
Actually

114
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,466
[SPEAKER_02]
the first starting from scratch

115
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:09,027
[SPEAKER_02]
In that act Jonathan Goldstein revisits a possibly familiar tale.

116
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,570
[SPEAKER_02]
of a man, a woman, a garden, and a snake. Stay with me.

117
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]
At one, puppy love the business model.

118
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:27,792
[SPEAKER_02]
Okay, you know there are mom and pop grocery stores, mom and pop newspapers.

119
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:31,049
[SPEAKER_02]
But could you throw everything away, change your life, start your life over?

120
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,934
[SPEAKER_02]
and create a mom and pop cable network.

121
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:37,410
[SPEAKER_02]
Molly Fitzsimmons' own father tried, and she has the answer.

122
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:41,190
[SPEAKER_01]
Some people's fathers quit their jobs and become teachers.

123
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,987
[SPEAKER_01]
Some may be retired early and start a new hobby like model building.

124
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:52,547
[SPEAKER_01]
My father, after turning over the reigns of the business he'd owned and operated for 25 years, started a cable channel.

125
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,252
[SPEAKER_01]
from scratch

126
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,293
[SPEAKER_01]
It was February 1995 and he was looking for something new to do, but he didn't know what.

127
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,774
[SPEAKER_01]
Then came the OJ trial.

128
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:08,899
[SPEAKER_01]
He just had back surgery and the day they sent him home for bed rest happened to be the day that the trial began.

129
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:13,455
[SPEAKER_01]
During the long breaks in the action, he would flip through the channels.

130
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,210
[SPEAKER_00]
there was so much downtime.

131
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,839
[SPEAKER_00]
in the trial, I had a chance to see everything that was on television.

132
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:20,138
[SPEAKER_00]
all day long

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,319
[SPEAKER_00]
for weeks

134
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,024
[SPEAKER_01]
You mean you just surfed online?

135
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,605
[SPEAKER_00]
The slow points in the trial were most of the day.

136
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:28,272
[SPEAKER_00]
And I spent the time surfing around.

137
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,972
[SPEAKER_00]
daytime television and seeing what it was.

138
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:38,582
[SPEAKER_01]
What it was was mostly soap operas, talk shows, reruns, game shows, things that my father had no interest in.

139
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:42,885
[SPEAKER_01]
My father is a problem solver, and this was a problem.

140
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,581
[SPEAKER_00]
So I thought, something else is necessary.

141
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,332
[SPEAKER_00]
There's a need for a parking place.

142
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,994
[SPEAKER_00]
on television if you don't want to watch something that is there

143
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,559
[SPEAKER_00]
You could have the TV set on.

144
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,870
[SPEAKER_00]
And it would be playing something that

145
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:59,339
[SPEAKER_00]
didn't bother you.

146
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:05,599
[SPEAKER_00]
would hold the place until your favorite show or what you chose to watch.

147
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:11,050
[SPEAKER_01]
For my father, like for a lot of people, simply turning off the television isn't an option.

148
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:18,660
[SPEAKER_01]
So he's stuck flipping through a bunch of shows that he hates waiting for the OJ trial to come back on when a little light bulb goes off in his head.

149
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,875
[SPEAKER_00]
I recalled

150
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,799
[SPEAKER_00]
My wife and I

151
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:26,811
[SPEAKER_00]
walking to lunch on a Friday in downtown Cleveland, walking into a building.

152
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:32,059
[SPEAKER_00]
The Animal Protective League had uh uh puppies.

153
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,274
[SPEAKER_00]
up for adoption.

154
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,392
[SPEAKER_00]
and the crowd of people standing around these puppies.

155
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,657
[SPEAKER_00]
included

156
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:42,252
[SPEAKER_00]
men in the in three-piece suits and women in

157
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,766
[SPEAKER_00]
in fancy outfits and

158
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:46,032
[SPEAKER_00]
Shoppers

159
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,525
[SPEAKER_00]
moms with kids in strollers, the the UPS man.

160
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:52,765
[SPEAKER_00]
And they stood together.

161
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:57,169
[SPEAKER_00]
smiling and chuckling and even sometimes addressing one another in the

162
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,970
[SPEAKER_00]
in the in the middle of a a big city building
